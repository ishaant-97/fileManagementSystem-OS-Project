## Overview

File System Simulation is a command-line utility that mimics a file system on a virtual disk. It offers a practical environment to explore file and directory operations, understand disk fragmentation, and evaluate wasted disk space. Whether you're learning about file systems or testing different scenarios, this tool can be a valuable educational resource.

## Key Features

- **File Management:** Create, store, rename, and delete files.
- **Directory Organization:** Organize files into directories and manage subdirectories.
- **Navigation:** Navigate through directories, including moving up to parent directories.
- **Disk Analysis:** Calculate disk fragmentation to assess file layout.
- **Space Efficiency:** Measure wasted disk space for optimizing storage usage.
- **Clean-Up:** Delete files and empty directories with ease.
